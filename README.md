# üß† CAB403 Systems Programming (Semester 2, 2025)

> _‚ÄúGet closer to the metal ‚Äî learn how modern systems really run.‚Äù_

This repository contains notes, code samples, and projects for **CAB403 ‚Äì Systems Programming** at QUT.  
The unit explores low-level programming using C, systems architecture, and safety-critical software design.

---

## üìò Unit Overview

**Coordinator:** Timothy Chappell  
**Languages/Tools:** C, Linux, low-level debugging utilities

CAB403 shifts focus from application-layer code to systems-layer programming. It develops practical skills in writing efficient and safe programs that interact closely with hardware and the operating system.

---

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

- Understand and describe modern **OS architecture** and components
- Apply **industry standards** in safety-critical systems development
- Evaluate the **societal and safety risks** of system-level failures
- Build **low-level programs in C** for real-world system tasks

---

## üß† Key Topics

- Operating system concepts and architectures  
- Memory management, file systems, device drivers  
- Threading and concurrency  
- Programming in C for performance and safety  
- Practical experience with systems-level toolchains  
- Industry applications of systems programming (e.g. aerospace, open-source)
